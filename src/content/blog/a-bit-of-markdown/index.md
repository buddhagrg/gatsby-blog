[From Wikipedia](https://wikipedia.org) **A paragraph** is a self-contained unit of discourse in writing dealing with a particular point or idea. A paragraph consists of one or more sentences.[1] Though not required by the syntax of any language, paragraphs are usually an expected part of formal writing, used to organize longer prose.
